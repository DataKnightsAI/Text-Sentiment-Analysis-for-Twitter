    "## Background\n",
    "For our course project we have chosen to conduct a sentiment analysis on a data set containing approximately 14.5 thousand tweets pertaining to 6 major US airlines. Going into this project we knew that we were interested in choosing a data set and problem that closely aligned to solving a topical business problem. We also wanted to pick a data set that would offer a certain degree of challenge and learning opportunities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our chosen data set aligns well with these goals for several reasons. Firstly, in the dozen or so years that Twitter has existed it has contributed to a significant shift in the way that companies interact with their customers, primarily from a customer service point of view, but additionally in terms of PR, marketing and even logistics. One tweet from the right (or wrong) person can set off a landslide of responses that can quickly become out of control. This is a particular concern for the US Airline industry. Over the past several years there have been several high-profile incidents causing negative public sentiment towards US airlines. We believe that a robust sentiment analysis model – specifically focused on identifying these negative sentiments before they become a larger problem - could help airlines better manage their PR crisis response and customer service. A sentiment analysis model tuned to identify negative tweets with a high degree of accuracy could help airlines analyse and learn from past Twitter trends and to rapidly identify new ones as they are occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, from the perspective of data science students a Twitter data offers an interesting challenge in terms of cleaning, interpretation and prediction. As Twitter caps each message at a short character limit, complete English is rarely used. The data set is full of abbreviations, slang, emojis and Twitter functions such as hashtags, mentions and re-tweets. Cleaning these out while retaining the information in the original tweet will be important to developing an effective model. As with many customer service data sets, this one is also likely to be unbalanced towards the negative sentiment side. Though this aligns well with our goal to primarily identify negative sentiment tweets, this will be important to consider as we clean the data.\n"

    "## Data Preparation\n",
    "The dataset downloaded manually from Kaggle contained a CSV and a Sqlite database file. Both files contain the same dataset, albeit in a different format. We chose to load the data using the CSV file because the dataset was not large enough to cause issues loading issues with the Pandas library. Also, the dataset had to be loaded with `UTF-8` encoding because we wanted to retain the information from emojis, which would be lost if we used another encoding, such as `CP-1252` We checked for nulls in `airline_sentiment`, `text`, and `negativereason` columns, although the dataset provided had no issues with nulls.\n",

    "## Cleaning Data\n",
    "Twitter data is notoriously \"unclean\" compared to the data of other NLP applications, such as newspaper articles, reviews, etc. As mentioned in the Background, Twitter's strict and small character limit means users must figure out ways of shortening their tweets into concise sentences. In practice, this means other forms of unorthodox written communication, such as Internet slang abbreviations, emojis, emoticons, hashtags, retweets, mentions, are employed regularly by users. \n",
    "\n",
    "For some of these methods of communication, such as mentions and retweets, they provide zero or negative value to our sentiment analysis; as a result, it is in our best interest to remove such text. Mentions are used by users to direct their messages to handles of other other users, such as airline companies in our case. In this dataset, mentions almost always contained the handles of airline companies, which is not very useful if most of the tweets, regardless of positive, neutral, or negative sentiment, contain those mentions. Similarly, retweets were often the tweets of the PR Twitter accounts/handles of airline companies. Because the retweets do not reflect the true sentiment of the user's specific tweet, and the retweets themselves are often of neutral or positive sentiment (never negative, because the tweet would be deleted and the person in charge of the PR Twitter account/handle would be in serious trouble), it is logical to remove retweets from the dataset since retweets will only prove to be \"noisy\" to our sentiment analysis model. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, other methods of communication such as emojis, emoticons, and hashtags could provide positive value to our sentiment analysis, since in theory visual/text elements such as emojis, and emoticons express a variety of emotions in a visual, or pseudo-visual image, which are possibly interlinked with the sentiment of the text. Hashtags could also be useful certain hashtags are associated with topics of positive, or negative sentimentality; for example, hashtags such as `#IceBucketChallenge` are linked with positive sentiments as the hashtag was used to encourage other people to perform acts of charity in a fun, positive manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the text of the users will have to be cleaned to ensure the text can be properly tokenized by the Spacy model. Such actions of cleaning the text include removing HTML encoding and HTTP links, converting the text to lower case, translating Internet slang abbreviations to their full English expressions, removing stop words and numbers and punctuation, and performing the lemmatization of the remaining text.\n",

    "Rather than removing emojis and emoticons, emojis and emoticons can be seen as an integral part of the Internet language. Therefore, we should extract emojis and emoticons from the text if they exist, as they may be good features for sentiment analysis for \"Internet\"-speak.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emojis are special characters which are shown as actual visual images, whereas emoticons are keyboard characters arranged in a certain format so that it represents a human-like facial expression. Emoticons are not as commonly used compared to emojis anymore, but are still used occassionally by people, and it is in our best interests to also extract emoticons as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a third-party Python library called 'emot', which provides the ability to recognize and extract both emojis and emoticons. Github can be found here: https://github.com/NeelShah18/emot. There was an issue with the library where emot.emoticons would return different JSON structures, either `{'flag': False}` or `{'value': [], 'mean': [], 'location': [], 'flag': False}` whenever emoticons were not found. Upon manually investigating a few examples with such issues, we found out that although this was an issue, it was true that there were no emoticons in the texts of those examples. Therefore, we got around this issue by writing a variety of try/except catches. \n"

    "We want to remove stop words because most common words such as \"the\", \"and\", \"I\", \"you\"  are not likely to add any value to our sentiment analysis. Removing stopwords will therefore reduce the noise that will reduce the effectiveness of our eventual sentiment analysis model. Removing stopwords is also beneficial in the sense that it also removes common contractions such as \"I've, you're, etc.\"\n",
